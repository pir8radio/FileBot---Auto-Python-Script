# FileBot---Auto-Python-Script
This script will watch a directory, unzip only files &lt; X gb within the zip, process them and delete the zip when done.

This script isn't polished or fully developed, but it gets the job done by monitoring a directory, automatically unzipping, renaming, moving, and cleaning up files without any manual intervention.

I use it to monitor a download folder on a server, I use my phone and download video files via torrent safe. Those files when done get automatically downloaded via https to the server, then this script kicks in.   Hope it helps someone with a similar need.  Please do PR's if you have better ways of doing things.   Again I just whipped this up to be short and sweet for me specific need.
